# toxic-comment
Toxic Comment Classification Challenge from kaggle
I tried to solve this challenge in 3 ways.
* Using logistic regression
* Using CNN
* Using LSTM

## USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION
I tried both bag of words approach vs tf-idf. As usual tf-idf had better score. With 91.9% accuracy I scored 0.9727 in Kaggle.

## USING CNN
Model overfitted with high training accuracy and low test score in kaggle

## USING LSTM
Model overfitted with high training accuracy and low test score in kaggle
